E-Z Billing is a software program that helps companies that sell managed print services bill equipment much simpler.  Managed print companies
can bill printers located within their customer sites.

You will first set up your company.  If a company exists, make sure you select that company when you sign up your user.
Once logged in, the managed print company should have a data collection agent that they work with.  On the DCA tab, they will need to enter their credentials so this program can acquire a token.
The user will then go to the customers tab and select the customers they would like to bill  (start and end date are required).
Once a customer has been added, the user will go to the printers tab.  On the printers tab, it will show all the printers for each of those customers the user selected.
The user will need to enter billing information for each printer.

Once billing information is added for the printers, the user can view monthly billing reports on the Reports tab.
